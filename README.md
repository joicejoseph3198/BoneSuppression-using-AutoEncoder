Chest X-ray (CXR) is a widely performed radiology examination that helps to detect abnormalities in the tissues and organs. Detecting abnormalities may become difficult due to that they are obscured by the presence of bony structures like the ribs and the clavicles, thereby resulting in misinterpretations. By building a deep learning-based bone suppression model to identify and remove these occluding bony structures in frontal CXRs can assist in reducing errors in radiological interpretations.
